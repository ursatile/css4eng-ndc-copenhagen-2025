	<p class="example">Meet Sven, a playful Eurasian otter who calls the pristine
		lakes of
		northern Sweden his home. With his sleek brown fur and webbed paws, Sven
		is perfectly adapted to the cold Scandinavian waters where he spends his
		days diving for fish and crayfish.</p>

	<p id="freddie-mercury">Every morning, Sven emerges from his cozy den along
		the rocky shoreline
		to begin his daily hunt. The Swedish wilderness provides him with an
		abundance of perch, pike, and trout, which he catches with remarkable
		skill and agility beneath the crystal-clear surface.</p>

	<p>During the long Swedish winters, when ice covers much of the lake, Sven
		must work harder to find breathing holes and access to his underwater
		hunting grounds. His thick fur and layer of fat keep him warm even in the
		harshest conditions.</p>

	<section id="alpha">

		<p id="beta">Sven shares his territory with other woodland creatures like elk, lynx,
			and brown bears, but he remains the undisputed master of his aquatic
			domain.

			<em id="gamma" class="highlight">His playful nature often leads him to slide down
				<strong id="delta">snowy banks
					<em id="epsilon" style="color: white !important;">into</em>
					the water</strong>, creating a joyful splash that echoes across the
				quiet forest.</em>
		</p>

		<p>As spring returns to Sweden and the midnight sun begins its long reign,
			Sven becomes more active, spending hours grooming his fur on sun-warmed
			rocks and teaching his young pups the ancient art of fishing in these
			timeless northern waters.</p>
