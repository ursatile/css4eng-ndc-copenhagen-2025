	<h1>Copenhagen: A Nordic Gem</h1>

	<p>Copenhagen,
		<span>Hey! I'm a div!</span>

		the capital and largest city of Denmark, stands as one of Europe's most
		charming
		and livable cities. With a population of approximately 650,000 in the city
		proper and over 2 million in the greater metropolitan area, Copenhagen
		serves
		as
		the political, economic, and cultural heart of Denmark.
	</p>

	<p>The city's history stretches back over a millennium, with its origins as a
		Viking fishing village called "Havn" (harbor). The name Copenhagen derives
		from "Køpmannæhavn," meaning "merchants' harbor," reflecting its early
		importance as a trading center. By the 12th century, it had grown into a
		significant medieval city, and in 1443, it became Denmark's capital.</p>

	<p>Copenhagen's architecture beautifully blends historical preservation with
		modern innovation. The colorful townhouses of Nyhavn, the 17th-century
		waterfront district, create one of the world's most photographed harbor
		scenes. The area bustles with restaurants, cafes, and historic wooden ships,
		embodying the city's maritime heritage. Meanwhile, contemporary
		architectural
		marvels like the Opera House and the Black Diamond library showcase
		Denmark's
		commitment to cutting-edge design.</p>

	<p>The city is renowned for its exceptional quality of life and progressive
		values. Copenhagen consistently ranks among the world's most livable cities,
		thanks to its excellent public transportation, extensive cycling
		infrastructure, and strong social welfare system. With over 400 kilometers
		of
		bike lanes, cycling isn't just transportation—it's a way of life. Nearly
		half
		of all residents commute by bicycle daily, making Copenhagen one of the
		world's most bike-friendly cities.</p>

	<p>Culturally, Copenhagen punches above its weight. The city is home to
		world-class museums like the National Gallery of Denmark and the Louisiana
		Museum of Modern Art. The Tivoli Gardens, one of the world's oldest
		amusement
		parks, has delighted visitors since 1843 and reportedly inspired Walt
		Disney.
		The Royal Danish Theatre and Copenhagen Opera House maintain the city's
		reputation as a cultural powerhouse.</p>

	<p>Copenhagen's culinary scene has undergone a remarkable transformation,
		evolving from traditional Danish fare to becoming a global gastronomic
		destination. The city boasts numerous Michelin-starred restaurants,
		including
		the famous Noma, which has revolutionized Nordic cuisine. The concept of
		"hygge"—a Danish philosophy emphasizing coziness and contentment—permeates
		the
		city's numerous cafes and restaurants.</p>

	<p>As a leader in sustainability, Copenhagen aims to become carbon-neutral by
		2025. The city has invested heavily in renewable energy, waste management,
		and
		green building practices. District heating systems, wind power, and
		extensive
		recycling programs demonstrate Copenhagen's commitment to environmental
		responsibility.</p>

	<p>Today, Copenhagen continues to thrive as a modern European capital while
		maintaining its distinctive Danish character, making it an irresistible
		destination for visitors and an enviable home for residents.</p>
